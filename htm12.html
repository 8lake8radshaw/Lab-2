        <h2>Dual Voting</h2>
        <p>
            Under the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system, each voter gets two votes. The first vote is cast for a specific candidate to represent their local electoral area, while the second vote is for a political party list. The aim of this dual voting mechanism is to ensure both local representation and overall proportionality in the elected body.
        </p>
        <p>
            The local representatives are elected using the first vote, often following a first-past-the-post system where the candidate with the most votes wins. The second vote, on the other hand, is used to elect additional members from party lists, ensuring the overall composition of the legislative body reflects the proportion of votes each party received.
