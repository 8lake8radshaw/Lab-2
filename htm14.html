        <h2>Party List System</h2>
        <p>
            The party list system is a type of proportional representation in which parties present lists of candidates for election. Voters then vote for a party rather than individual candidates. The number of seats a party gains in the legislature is determined by the proportion of votes it receives.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system ensures a more equitable representation for parties, allowing smaller parties to have a voice in the legislature. The party list system can be "closed" where the party fixes the order of candidates on the list, or "open" where voters can influence the order by marking individual candidates.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main advantage of the party list system is that it promotes a multi-party democracy, making it more likely for a variety of voices to be heard. However, it may also lead to fragmentation in the legislature if too many small parties gain representation.
