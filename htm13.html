        <h2>Local Representatives</h2>
        <p>
            Local representatives play a crucial role in a democratic system, serving as the direct link between the constituents and the larger legislative or governing body. Their primary responsibility is to voice the concerns, interests, and aspirations of the people from their specific electoral areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically, local representatives are elected based on a first-past-the-post system in their specific constituencies. This means that the candidate with the most votes in a particular area is elected as the representative. Their role involves not only law-making but also addressing local issues, organizing community events, and acting as a bridge between the government and the public.
